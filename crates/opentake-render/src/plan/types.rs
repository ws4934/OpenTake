//! RenderPlan data structures (SPEC §2.2).
//!
//! Two layers, mirroring upstream's static `trackMappings` + dynamic
//! `buildVisuals` split (VideoEngine L169/L195):
//!
//! - [`RenderPlan`] — frame-independent: which tracks, which clips (deduped /
//!   sorted), each clip's source type + natSize + preferredTransform + blend
//!   order + canvas size + fps + total frames. Parsed once from a `Timeline`.
//! - [`FramePlan`] (via [`RenderPlan::frame`](crate::plan::RenderPlan::frame)) —
//!   instantaneous: an ordered `Vec<LayerDraw>` for one frame, each carrying the
//!   affine matrix / crop UV / opacity sampled by the domain `*_at` methods.
//!
//! The black background is NOT a clip here — it is the compositor clear color
//! `(0,0,0,1)` (SPEC §3.5).
