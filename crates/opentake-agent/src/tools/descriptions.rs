        ToolName::GetTimeline => "Always call at the start of a session. Returns project settings (fps, resolution, totalFrames), track list with types and order, all clips with their frames and properties, and canGenerate (if false, generation/upscale tools will fail — tell the user to sign in to OpenTake and subscribe before attempting them). The clipId/trackId values here are what every other tool accepts.\n\nClip and track fields equal to their defaults are omitted: mediaType 'video', sourceClipType = mediaType, speed 1, volume 1, opacity 1, trims/fades 0, identity transform/crop, default textStyle, track muted/hidden false. Text clips never report trims (no source media).\n\nCaption clips (sharing a captionGroupId) come back per track as captionGroups instead of clips entries: properties common to the group are hoisted into 'shared' and each clip is a [clipId, startFrame, durationFrames, text] row (caption box width/height are auto-fit per text and omitted). Rows are capped at 200 per group — when clipCount exceeds the rows shown, page with startFrame/endFrame. Caption clips whose properties deviate from the group appear individually in clips.",

        ToolName::GetMedia => "Call before referencing any asset. Every mediaRef/reference ID in other tools comes from the IDs returned here. Also exposes generationStatus (generating | downloading | failed | none) for async-generated and -imported assets.",

        ToolName::InspectMedia => "Look at a media asset before referencing or editing it. Images: the image plus dimensions and EXIF. Video: sample frames plus a transcription of the audio track. Audio: transcription. Lottie: frames sampled evenly across the animation (over gray), plus framerate and duration — use this to verify a Lottie you wrote looks and moves right. Transcription is sentence-level segments — [text, start, end] tuples, capped at 400 — in source seconds, or project frames when clipId is set. When capped, pass the returned nextStartSeconds as startSeconds for the next page.\n\nLong media: pass overview=true for a one-image storyboard, read the segments, then re-call with startSeconds/endSeconds to zoom — windowed calls only transcribe that span, so they are fast.",

        ToolName::GetTranscript => "Returns the spoken transcript of the CURRENT timeline in project frames — the post-edit caption track in one call. Unlike inspect_media (which transcribes one source asset in isolation, in source seconds), this walks every audio/video clip on the timeline, maps each word through that clip's trim/speed/position, and concatenates in timeline order. Deleted ranges are gone by construction, so after cuts this always reflects what's actually audible — no stale results, no per-clip frame math.\n\nReturns clips in timeline order, each with its words nested as compact [text, startFrame, endFrame] rows (the field order is given once in wordFormat) — clipId and trackIndex are stated once per clip, not repeated per word. Words are monotonic and non-overlapping; each is attributed to one clip, so a word split across a clip seam is emitted once, not re-emitted per clip. Pass a clip's clipId and a word's frames straight to ripple_delete_ranges. Capped at 10000 words total; page with startFrame/endFrame using nextStartFrame. Pass clipId to scope to a single clip (\"what does this clip say?\"). Transcription runs on-device.\n\nUse for transcript-driven edits (filler-word / dead-air removal, locating a quote, take selection) and to verify what remains after cutting.",

        ToolName::InspectTimeline => "See the composited timeline — what the user actually sees in the preview at a given frame: all video tracks stacked with their transforms, opacity, crop, and keyframes applied, plus text and caption overlays baked in. Use this to verify your edits landed (a PIP's position, a title's placement, layer order) — inspect_media shows the raw source asset, not the cut.\n\nFrames are project frames (from get_timeline). Pass a single startFrame for one composited frame; add endFrame to sample maxFrames evenly across [startFrame, endFrame) for a transition or sequence. Frames past content render black. Returns frames downscaled for token efficiency, with the frameNumbers sampled.",

        ToolName::SearchMedia => "Search the media library by content: what's on screen (visual) and what's said (spoken). Visual matching is semantic and on-device — phrase the query like an image caption ('a wide shot of a harbor at sunset'), not keywords; covers videos and stills. Spoken matching layers exact keywords over on-device semantic matching of transcript segments — quote the words said, or paraphrase them; transcripts are created automatically while indexing (and by inspect_media and add_captions), so coverage grows as indexing completes. The two groups rank independently and are never blended. Scores are uncalibrated — use them for ordering only.\n\nHits are source-second ranges. To place exactly that moment, multiply by fps and pass as trimStartFrame/trimEndFrame with a matching durationFrames to add_clips or set_clip_properties. Image hits have no time range.\n\nstatus reports the visual index: ready | indexing | modelNotInstalled | downloadingModel | preparing | disabled | failed. When not ready, moments may be empty or incomplete (compare indexedAssets to indexableAssets) — report that instead of concluding the footage doesn't exist, and don't poll in a loop. Spoken results work regardless of status.",

        ToolName::AddClips => "Places one or more media assets on the timeline as a single undoable action. Each entry's asset type must be compatible with its target track (video/image are interchangeable across video/image tracks; audio requires an audio track). When a video asset with audio is placed on a video track, a linked audio clip is automatically created on an audio track (an existing one if available, otherwise a new one). The whole batch is one undo step.\n\ntrackIndex is optional. Omit it on all entries and the tool auto-creates the needed tracks — one shared video track for visual entries and one shared audio track for audio entries (matches the captioning pattern in add_texts). To target existing tracks, set trackIndex on every entry. Mixing (some entries specify, others omit) is rejected — split into two calls.\n\nTracks work as layers: clips on the SAME track are sequential — if a new clip's range overlaps an existing clip on that track, the existing clip is trimmed/split/removed to make room, matching the UI's drag-onto-track overwrite behavior.",

        ToolName::InsertClips => "Inserts one or more media assets at a single point and RIPPLES: every clip at or after atFrame is pushed right to open a gap, so nothing is overwritten. This is the non-destructive counterpart to add_clips (which clears the landing region, trimming/splitting/removing whatever's there). Use insert_clips to splice footage in without losing existing clips; use add_clips to fill empty space or deliberately overwrite.\n\nEntries are laid end-to-end starting at atFrame on the target track (entry[0] at atFrame, entry[1] immediately after, ...). The push equals the sum of the entries' durations and is applied to the target track, every sync-locked track, AND the audio track any auto-created linked audio lands on — so a clip and its linked audio stay aligned. As in add_clips, a video asset with audio spawns a linked audio clip. One undoable action; one bad entry rejects the whole call with no partial state.\n\ntrackIndex is required — ripple needs an existing track to push. For placement into empty space, use add_clips.",

        ToolName::RemoveClips => "Removes one or more clips by ID as a single undoable action. Any clip that belongs to a link group (e.g. a video with its paired audio) takes its whole group with it, matching the UI's linked-delete behavior.",

        ToolName::RemoveTracks => "Removes whole tracks and every clip on them in one undoable action. Linked partners on OTHER tracks are not removed. Remaining track indexes shift down after removal.",

        ToolName::MoveClips => "Moves one or more clips to a new track and/or frame position. Single undoable action. Each move specifies the clip ID and at least one of toTrack (must be compatible with the clip's media type) and toFrame. Overlap on the destination is resolved as in add_clips (existing clips on the destination track are trimmed/split/removed). Linked partners follow the named clip: startFrame propagates as a delta to preserve l-cut / j-cut offsets; tracks stay with the named clip.",

        ToolName::SetClipProperties => "Apply the same property values to one or more clips in a single undoable action. Pass any combination of durationFrames, trimStartFrame, trimEndFrame, speed, volume, opacity, transform, reversed, or — for text clips only — content, fontName, fontSize, color, alignment. All values are applied to every clip in clipIds; for per-clip differences, make separate calls. transform is currently single-clip only because partial width/height merges depend on each clip's source aspect; make separate calls for multiple transform edits. trimStartFrame/trimEndFrame are offsets from the source media, not the timeline. speed 1.0 is normal, <1.0 slows (clip gets longer on the timeline), >1.0 speeds up. Changing speed or durationFrames proportionally rescales existing animation keyframes before clamping. This tool does NOT ripple following clips: inspect available space and use move_clips explicitly when needed. The Inspector uses a separate ripple-enabled speed command that rejects collisions rather than overwriting unrelated content. reversed=true plays video clips backward through their referenced source window; non-video clips ignore it. volume is linear gain from 0 to the Inspector's +15 dB ceiling (about 5.6234); opacity is 0.0–1.0. transform uses normalized canvas coords; partial merge (pass only centerY to reposition vertically); flipHorizontal/flipVertical mirror the clip across the corresponding axis (no effect on text clips). When a text clip's content or font changes without an explicit transform, the bounding box auto-refits. Text-only fields with any non-text clip in clipIds are rejected.\n\nFor moves and start-frame changes, use move_clips. For animated values (keyframes), use set_keyframes — setting volume or opacity here clears any existing keyframe track on that property.\n\nTiming changes (durationFrames, trimStartFrame, trimEndFrame, speed) on a linked clip carry over to its linked partner so audio/video stay in sync — same as the timeline UI. Per-clip fields (volume, opacity, transform, reversed, text*) don't propagate. trim and speed are skipped for text partners.",

        ToolName::SetKeyframes => "Set animated keyframes on one property of one clip. Replaces the existing keyframe track for that property (pass an empty array to clear). Frames are CLIP-RELATIVE offsets (0 = first frame of the clip), so keyframes follow the clip when it moves; each frame must be an integer from 0 through the clip's durationFrames. Rows are sorted by frame internally and the LAST row for any duplicate frame wins. Values must be finite numbers. Each row is `[frame, ...values, interp?]` where interp ∈ {linear, hold, smooth} (default smooth).\n\nProperties and their value layouts:\n  • volume `[frame, value]` — value 0.0–1.0\n  • opacity `[frame, value]` — value 0.0–1.0\n  • rotation `[frame, degrees]` — clockwise degrees\n  • position `[frame, topLeftX, topLeftY]` — TOP-LEFT corner in 0–1 normalized canvas coords. NOT the center. (Default static transform centers a full-canvas clip, so top-left of the static is (0, 0); a centered half-size clip has top-left (0.25, 0.25).)\n  • scale `[frame, width, height]` — clip's normalized width and height in 0–1 canvas coords (1.0 = fills the canvas axis). NOT a scale factor.\n  • crop `[frame, top, right, bottom, left]` — side insets in 0–1 of the source media.\n\nMotion keyframes (position/scale/rotation) override the static `transform` value when active.",

        ToolName::SplitClip => "Splits a clip into two at atFrame. The frame must be strictly between the clip's start and end — use get_timeline to confirm the range.",

        ToolName::RippleDeleteRanges => "Cuts one or more ranges out and closes the gaps in one undoable action — the fast path for filler-word/dead-air removal. Replaces hand-cranked split_clip → split_clip → remove_clips → move_clips loops: pass every range at once.\n\nTwo modes — pass exactly one of clipId or trackIndex:\n• trackIndex (preferred for transcript-driven cuts): ranges are PROJECT frames and may span any number of clips on that track. get_transcript returns a clips array with nested words in project frames — collect every cut across the whole timeline and pass them in ONE call, no per-clip splitting and no re-reading the timeline between cuts. units must be 'frames'.\n• clipId: ranges are cut within that single clip only, clamped to its visible span. Allows units 'seconds' (source-media seconds, e.g. inspect_media WITHOUT a clipId or search_media hits); 'frames' = project frames. Use when you already have one clip's per-word timestamps.\n\nOverlapping ranges merge. Linked audio/video partners of every touched clip are cut on the same span so A/V stays in sync. Remaining clips shift left to close every gap; sync-locked tracks shift along to preserve alignment (their content isn't cut). Refuses without changing anything if a sync-locked track can't absorb the shift (e.g. it would move past frame 0). Returns the anchor track's post-cut layout (clip ids/frames) so you don't need to re-read.",

        ToolName::Undo => "Reverts the assistant's most recent timeline edit (a cut, move, trim, split, or clip/text/caption add) as one step. The recovery path when an edit went too far — e.g. a ripple_delete_ranges removed more than intended. Verify a cut first (get_transcript reflects the post-cut audio), then undo if it overshot, then retry with corrected ranges.\n\nUndoes only edits the assistant made this session, most-recent-first — it never touches the user's own manual edits, and refuses if the latest change wasn't the assistant's. After undoing, the timeline is restored to its state before that edit; the ids/frames the edit returned are no longer valid, so re-read with get_timeline or get_transcript if you'll edit again. Takes no arguments.",

        ToolName::AddTexts => "Adds one or more text clips (titles, captions, lower-thirds) in a single undoable action. Text renders as an overlay on top of visual media. Transform uses 0–1 normalized canvas coords: (0.5,0.5) is center, (0.5,0.1) top-center, (0.5,0.9) bottom-center. Omit transform to center + auto-fit. Pass only centerX/centerY to reposition with auto-fit size (common for lower-thirds). Pass all four fields to override the box entirely. Colors are hex '#RRGGBB' or '#RRGGBBAA'.\n\ntrackIndex is optional. Omit it on all entries and the tool auto-creates one new video track at the top and places all text clips there — the common case for captions. To target existing tracks, set trackIndex on every entry (audio tracks rejected). Mixing (some entries specify, others omit) is rejected — split into two calls.\n\nTracks work as layers: clips on the SAME track are sequential — if a new clip's range overlaps an existing (or earlier-batch) clip on that track, the existing clip is trimmed/split/removed to make room, matching the UI's drag-onto-track overwrite behavior. To show multiple text clips at the same time (stacked titles, simultaneous labels), put each on a DIFFERENT trackIndex so they layer instead of trimming each other.\n\nFor captioning spoken audio, prefer add_captions — it transcribes and places styled caption clips in one call. Use add_texts only for bespoke text (titles, lower-thirds) or captioning a custom range by hand. Unknown fields are rejected.",

        ToolName::AddCaptions => "Auto-caption spoken audio: transcribes on-device and places styled caption clips on a new track — the same pipeline as the editor's Captions tab. This is the reliable path for 'caption this'; prefer it over hand-placing add_texts from a transcript. Omit clipIds to auto-pick the track with the most speech; pass clipIds to caption specific clips (e.g. only the interview).",

The default write=false returns beat frames, suggested cut frames, and clip placement hints without mutation. Set write=true to align the selected visual clips and their linked A/V partners through one atomic MoveClips command.",

        ToolName::SmartReframe => "Plans subject-aware reframing for target aspect ratios such as 9:16 or 1:1. The typed surface is present, but MCP frame sampling / vision analysis is not wired yet; calls return a deterministic needs-vision-backend error and do not mutate the timeline.",

        ToolName::TightenSilences => "Plans silence tightening by finding low-energy PCM spans and converting them into ripple_delete_ranges candidate commands. Returns a preview only; it does not mutate the timeline. Run the returned commands in the listed order. Linked clips in clipIds are analyzed once (the audio member) because a ripple cut also cuts linked partners.",

        ToolName::RemoveFillerWords => "Transcribes the current spoken timeline and returns reviewable filler-word cuts aligned to word timestamps. Supports an exact configurable lexicon including multi-word phrases. It does not mutate the timeline: remove rejected cuts, then call the returned ripple_delete_ranges commands in the listed order (each is one undoable edit) to apply the accepted ranges.

Returns a placeholder asset ID immediately; the asset appears in get_media and becomes usable in add_clips once ready. TTS models (elevenlabs-tts-v3, gemini-3.1-flash-tts) convert the prompt into speech and accept a 'voice'. Music models (lyria3-pro, minimax-music-v2.6, elevenlabs-music, sonilo-v1.1-video-to-music) generate tracks from a prompt; include lyrics/tempo/vocal style in the prompt for Lyria 3 Pro, pass 'lyrics' for MiniMax vocals, or set 'instrumental' true when the selected model supports it. Video-to-audio models (inputs include 'video' — see list_models, e.g. sonilo-v1.1-video-to-music, mirelo-sfx-v1.5-video-to-audio) generate audio that matches a VIDEO: provide a timeline span via videoSourceStartFrame+videoSourceEndFrame (e.g. to score the timeline), or a video asset via videoSourceMediaRef; the prompt is then an optional style guide. PLACEMENT: when you pass a timeline span, the result is placed on the timeline automatically at that span (no add_clips needed); for a media-asset source or a plain text-to-speech/music result, the asset lands in the library and you place it with add_clips.
