//! `MediaBridge` — the injected side-door to the two capabilities that live
//! outside `opentake-core`: GPU compositing (in `opentake-render`, driven from
//! `src-tauri`) and the user-facing media-import machinery (in
//! `src-tauri/src/media.rs`, behind `MediaState`/`MediaEngine`).
//!
//! Why a *separate* trait instead of widening [`CoreHandle`](super::core_handle):
//! [`CoreHandle`] is deliberately the narrow *document* surface (read timeline,
//! read media, apply one command, project dir, decode analysis PCM). Its
//! production impl wraps only [`opentake_core::AppCore`]. The two capabilities the
//! media tools need reach into crates the agent layer does **not** — and by design
//! should not — link: `opentake-render` (wgpu) for compositing, and the
//! `src-tauri` import path (posters / manifest / events) for `import_media`.
//! Folding them into `CoreHandle` would either drag a GPU dependency into this
//! crate or hide logic behind default methods that can't reach the real paths.
//!
//! So the bridge is injected exactly like the plugin registry is — an optional
//! collaborator the [`Dispatcher`](super::dispatch::Dispatcher) holds. In a plain
//! `vite dev` / non-Tauri build (and in unit tests) there is no bridge and the two
//! tools report an honest "not available" instead of failing to compile. The real
//! implementation is constructed and injected in `src-tauri/src/mcp.rs`, where the
//! render + import code already lives.
//!
//! Both methods default to `Err("unsupported")` so a hand-rolled bridge (or the
//! absence of one) never breaks the build.
